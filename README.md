# Matlab-Projects
Programs using Matlab to analyze scientific computational methods.

PROJECTS:

Project 1:
Consists of files: quadroot.m, test file NAProg1test.m and results in prog1run. Evaluates a polynimal's roots using the quadratic formula. 
Also error checks for overflow and flags non-quadratic polynomials.

Project 2:
Consists of files: bisect.m, fofx.m and secant.m, test file NAProg2test.m and results in prog2run.txt. Evaluates the roots of a function 
using bisection and secant methods. Also returns the number of function evaluations executed for each method.

Project 3:
Consists of files: lagrangeval.m, test file NAProg3test.m and results in prog3run.txt. Evaluates the lagrange interpolant for a set 
of knots.

Project 5:
Consists of files: euler.m, rk4.m, fofty.m, test file NAProg5test.m and results in prog5run.txt. Approximates the IVP using Euler 
and Runge-Kutta order 4 methods.
